m<n
and
p
p<m
parallel
processors working
synchronously the
paper
presents
an
algorithm
for
merging
a
and
b
with
the
p
parallel
processors which
requires
at
most
2log2
2m+1+3m/p

m/plog2
n/m
steps if
n

2bm
b
an
integer the
algorithm
requires
at
most
2log2
m+1

m/p2+b
steps in
the
case
where
m
and
n
are
of
the same
order
of
magnitude
ie
n=km
with
k
being
a
constant
the
algorithm
requires
2log2
m+1

m/p3+k steps these
performances
compare
very
favorably
with
the
previous
best
parallel
merging
algorithm batchers
algorithm
which
requires
np

m+n/2plog2
m
steps
in
the
general
case
and
kmp

k+1/2m/plog2 m
in
the
special
case
where
n=km cacm
