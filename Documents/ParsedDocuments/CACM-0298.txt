a 48-bit pseudo-random number generatora new 48-bit pseudo-random number generator suitablefor several computers was tested statistically for randomness to determine its adequacy for use in montecarlo programs frequency tests distributions of certain low-order moments runs up and down and runsabove and below the mean were applied to one-half million generated numbers lying within the interval(0,1 and to three sets of integers obtained from specified bits within the generated numbers thesetests substantiated the randomness of all numbers except for the set of integers coming from the least significant bits.cacm august 1961kuehn h g.ca610806 jb march 16 1978 10:09 pm298 5 298298 5 298298 5 298
